# Connect 4 AI

## Overview

This project implements a Connect 4 game with an AI player that can be configured to use different decision-making strategies. The game is designed with several algorithms for AI play, including **Minimax**, **Pruning Minimax** (with Alpha-Beta Pruning), and **Expected Minimax**. Additionally, it visualizes the Minimax decision tree for a more interactive and educational experience.

## Features

- **Two-player game** (Human vs AI).
- **AI modes:**
    - **Minimax**: Standard decision-making where the AI maximizes its score and minimizes the opponentâ€™s score.
    - **Pruning Minimax (Alpha-Beta Pruning)**: Optimized version of Minimax to reduce the search space.
    - **Expected Minimax**: Handles probabilistic outcomes for games with chance events.
    - **Interactive game board** with easy-to-use mechanics.
    - **Visualization**: The Minimax tree is visualized using Tkinter, which provides an interactive graphical representation of the decision-making process.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a **7x6 board**.
2. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into the columns.
3. The player with the maximum aligned **4 discs** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. The AI can be configured with different strategies, including Minimax or Expected Minimax, with varying difficulty levels.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    
2. Install Tkinter (if it's not already installed with Python)
    - On **Ubuntu/Debian**:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install python3-tk
        ```
        
    - On **macOS** and **Windows**, Tkinter is usually bundled with Python, so no installation is required.
3. Run the Game
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Performance Optimization

### Performance Optimization with Backtracking:

- **Purpose**: Allows the algorithm to simulate potential moves and then "undo" them, efficiently exploring all possible game states without copying the board many times.
- **Optimization Benefit**: Saves memory and computational resources by reusing the same board object rather than creating a new one for each state
- **In Code**:
    - `add_piece` applies a move to explore a branch of the game tree.
    - `remove_piece` reverts the move, restoring the board to its previous state.

### **Performance Optimization with Memoization**

- **Purpose**: Avoids redundant calculations by storing previously evaluated board states (game tree nodes) in a cache.
- **Optimization Benefit**:
    - **Speeds up repeated evaluations**: If a game state is reached multiple times, its precomputed result is reused.
    - **Reduces computational complexity**: Prevents recalculating heuristic scores for identical board states, especially in deeper levels of the game tree.
